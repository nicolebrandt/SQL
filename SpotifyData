# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

Data was then explored using SQL. 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata; 

# I organized and manipulated the data in terms of energy. 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc; 

# I determined the average song duration per artist. 
SELECT AVG(duration_ms), artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name; 

# I determined the artists who had mutliple songs listed within the data and ordered them from the most songs to least.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(track_name) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) desc; 

# I determined which songs had song_key greater than 6 AND which their duration was longer than 200000. 
SELECT track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key > 8
AND duration_ms > 200000; 

# I determined the top ten most popular songs of 2021. 
SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

# I determined the average erngy and song duration of the data. 
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

# I determined the avgerage popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy) 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
